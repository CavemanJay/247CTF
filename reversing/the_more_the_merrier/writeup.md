# Prompt

> One byte is great. But what if you need more? Can you find the flag hidden in this binary?

# Solution

## Initial Assessment

### Execution

Running the binary just prints an unhelpful message to the screen:

![Execution](./img/execution.png)

### Strings

Looking at the strings for the binary doesn't give us anything helpful either:

```
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
libc.so.6
puts
__cxa_finalize
__libc_start_main
GLIBC_2.2.5
_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
__gmon_start__
_ITM_registerTMCloneTable
AWAVI
AUATL
[]A\A]A^A_
Nothing to see here..
;*3$"
.shstrtab
.interp
.note.ABI-tag
.note.gnu.build-id
.gnu.hash
.dynsym

.init
.plt.got
.text
.fini
.rodata
.eh_frame_hdr
.eh_frame
.init_array
.fini_array
.dynamic
.data
.bss
```

## Ghidra

At this point I take the binary and toss it into ghidra to see what we're working with.

The decompilation of the main function doesn't show us anything interesting either:

![main_decomp](./img/main_decomp.png)

The dissassembly is quite a bit more interesting though. 
Looking at it, we see that some value at \[DAT_001006e8\] is being referenced but not used.

![main_dissassembly](./img/main_diss.png)

Looking at the bytes of that address reveals the flag with each character surrounded by null bytes.
This null byte padding around the characters is what prevented the `strings` command from recognizing the flag as a string (and ghidra as well).

![flag bytes](./img/flag_bytes.png)

Using the pwntools library and a bit of python, we can extract these flag bytes as seen in [my script](./get_flag.py).

## Alternative

Since we now know that the flag exists within the binary as a string (with some null padding issues) we can use a bit of shell magic to extract it.

```sh
strings -n 1 the_more_the_merrier | awk '{print}' ORS='' | grep -o 247CTF{.*}
```

### Command Breakdown

- `strings -n 1 the_more_the_merrier`
    - Display all printable characters contained within the binary
    - Strings will only print strings of length 4 or greater by default (thus the -n 1 flag)
- `awk '{print}' ORS=''`
    - Replace all newlines from the strings command with empty string (so we can grep)
- `grep -o 247CTF{.*}`
    - Extract the flag ðŸ˜Ž
